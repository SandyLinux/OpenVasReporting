Anybody who\n     has access to a router, switch, hub or gateway located on the network between\n     the two hosts where Telnet is being used can intercept the packets passing by\n     and obtain login and password information (and whatever else is typed) with any\n     of several common utilities like tcpdump and Wireshark.\n\n  * Most implementations of Telnet have no authentication that would ensure\n     communication is carried out between the two desired hosts and not intercepted\n     in the middle.\n\n  * Commonly used Telnet daemons have several vulnerabilities discovered over\n     the years.|qod_type=remote_banner",

Anybody who\n     has access to a router, switch, hub or gateway located on the network between\n     the two hosts where Telnet is being used can intercept the packets passing by\n     and obtain login and password information (and whatever else is typed) with any\n     of several common utilities like tcpdump and Wireshark.\n\n  * Most implementations of Telnet have no authentication that would ensure\n     communication is carried out between the two desired hosts and not intercepted\n     in the middle.\n\n  * Commonly used Telnet daemons have several vulnerabilities discovered over\n     the years.|qod_type=remote_banner",

Anybody who\n     has access to a router, switch, hub or gateway located on the network between\n     the two hosts where Telnet is being used can intercept the packets passing by\n     and obtain login and password information (and whatever else is typed) with any\n     of several common utilities like tcpdump and Wireshark.\n\n  * Most implementations of Telnet have no authentication that would ensure\n     communication is carried out between the two desired hosts and not intercepted\n     in the middle.\n\n  * Commonly used Telnet daemons have several vulnerabilities discovered over\n     the years.|qod_type=remote_banner",

Anybody who\n     has access to a router, switch, hub or gateway located on the network between\n     the two hosts where Telnet is being used can intercept the packets passing by\n     and obtain login and password information (and whatever else is typed) with any\n     of several common utilities like tcpdump and Wireshark.\n\n  * Most implementations of Telnet have no authentication that would ensure\n     communication is carried out between the two desired hosts and not intercepted\n     in the middle.\n\n  * Commonly used Telnet daemons have several vulnerabilities discovered over\n     the years.|qod_type=remote_banner",
